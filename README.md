## Campus Connect: A Flutter & Dart App
Let us a take a look at the idea behind the app along with the use cases and features that it has to offer

### Concept & Overview
Campus Connect is a cross-platform, non-native, mobile-first Flutter- and Dart-based application built with the aim of improving communication throughout the university campuses by squeezing the communication gap among students, management and administration

### Learning Curve & Development Timeline
Uzair Afzal developed this app in the Summer break (2021) as a rising final-year computer science and software engineering student, so that he could exercise his recently-acquired Flutter and Dart skills

The project spanned over 4 weeks (June - July, 2021), where, at first, he learnt the basics of Dart programming language and Flutter framework. Afterwards, he put all his learning into this one holistic project to create a real, tangible product out of it


### Features & Use Cases
As Campus Connect focuses on decreasing the communication gap across the campuses, it has to offer the following features as mentioned below. Remember, each feature gets its own place in a separate sequence of screens, which is setup inside the bottom tab navigator on the home page of the application. In Campus Connect you can:

  * Share exciting university news, like the advent of the Facebook innovation Labs at LUMS or the appointment of new VC
  * Share upcoming event details, like the student council events or student society events
  * Make announcements for students and staff, like the new smoking policy on campus
  * Initiate hashtags, like #OpenLUMS, and follow them up with loads of amazing posts
  * One can add new news, events, announcements and hashtags after logging in using Zambeel ID and password
  * Campus Connect also allows you to take a look at your profile as well as get information about the developers of the app through a drawer navigator, implemented    in the home
  * You can also choose to log out of the app at any time by clicking the log out button in the drawer

### Limitations & Simplifications
The current implementation of Campus Connect focuses only on bringing smooth and reliable communication experience across Lahore University of Management Sciences' (LUMS) campus, but extensions can be made to make the app more generic by bringing other universities on-board as well

### Future Extension Plans
As of now, no extension plans have been made, at least not by Uzair. In case the idea catches on and there really is a need for one such app, it will be extended and a fully functional back-end will be added as well

### Run Campus Connect Locally 
At first, you must have full setup on your local machine for Flutter UI toolkit and Dart programming language. Afterwards, clone this GitHub repository or simply download the zipped files from here and run the following command in the same directory's terminal / bash

```bash 
  flutter run -d chrome
```

Be notified that this is not the only way of running a Flutter-based app, but this is certainly the easiest way of running such an app, as it takes advantage of Google Chrome's remote debugging service and does not demand the installation of any Android emulators or Android SDKs

### App Deployment
As of yet, the application is not deployed anywhere. If it is deployed in the future, the README file will be updated and the link will be added down below
